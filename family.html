          <p>
            Human ancestry dates back to time immemorial and can be difficult to
            trace. An Indian or a Keralite today might have origins in the
            African continent or from a landmass that is now submerged or
            untraceable. It is best to document ancestry from the point where
            some knowledge is available. This attempt is made with that
            perspective in mind, aiming for a satisfactory account.
          </p>

            <span class="fs-4 text-uppercase hero-sub-title">Ancestry: </span>My
            ancestral family, to my knowledge, originated from Kochu Kaleekkal,
            Kallelibhagam, Karunagappally, Kollam, Kerala. It was primarily an
            agricultural family.
          </p>

            <span class="fs-4 text-uppercase hero-sub-title"
              >Maternal Lineage: </span
            >My mother, P. Santhamma, is the daughter of K. Pankajakshi Amma of
            Kochu Kaleekkal House, Kallelibhagam, Thodiyur Panchayat,
            Karunagappally Taluk, Kollam District, and Kunjan Pillai of the
            Thuppadayyath family from the same place. Santhamma had a brother,
            K. Karunakaran Pillai, who was a traditional vaidyan and ran an
            Ayurvedic center and indigenous medicine shop. <br />
            <br />

            Pankajakshi Amma’s (my grandmother’s) mother was Kalyani Amma, and
            her father was Govinda Pillai. Kalyani Amma belonged to the Kochu
            Kaleekkal family, and Govinda Pillai was from Perinad, Kollam. From
            Perinad, they moved to Panmana and later to Kallelibhagam. Kalyani
            Amma's mother was Nangeli Amma of the Kaleekkal family of
            Kallelibhagam. <br />
            <br />
            Pankajakshi Amma had two sisters, Parvathi Amma and Lakshmi Amma,
            and four brothers: • Kunjan Pillai, who settled at Thodiyur Aikkara
            Padinjattathil • Raghavan Pillai, who settled at Mararithottam •
            Kuttan Pillai, who settled at Krishnapuram near Ochira • Chellappan
            Pillai, who settled at Kavanal Tharayil, Thodiyur

            retired as a Headmaster. He was actively involved in politics and
            teachers' organizations, including the Communist Party of India.
            After the party split, he initiated another organization, the Kerala
            Government Primary School Teachers' Union, serving as its General
            Secretary and President. Upon being promoted to Headmaster, he
            worked as the General Secretary and later as the President of the
            Kerala Government Primary School Headmasters' Association. After
            retirement, he served as a State-level Executive Member of the
            Kerala Land Mortgage Bank and a Director Board Member of the
            Karunagappally Land Mortgage Bank. <br />
            <br />
            His father, Velayudhan Pillai, was from Valiyavilayil, South
            Mynagappally, Kollam, and his mother, Kalyani Amma, was also from
            South Mynagappally.
