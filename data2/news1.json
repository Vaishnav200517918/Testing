Ajith Kumar\nPresident\nPeople for Better Society (PEBS)\nThiruvananthapuram - 4\n</br>\n</br>\nTo\nThe Hon'ble Prime Minister of India\nNew Delhi\n</br>\n</br>\nSubject: Request to Include Disaster Management in the Union List - Regarding\n</br>\n</br>\nRespected Sir,\n</br>\n</br>\nI am writing this letter to bring to your kind attention the urgent need to include disaster management under the Union List in our Constitution. While state governments have been provided with funds for disaster management and have established respective departments and district-level facilities to handle such situations, the ground reality during major disasters has consistently revealed that state-level resources alone are insufficient.\n</br>\n</br>\nIn every significant disaster that has occurred in recent years, the most effective and impactful interventions have been carried out by the military and the Central Disaster Management authorities. While state governments do their best within their capacities, the expertise, resources, and coordination required to manage large-scale disasters effectively are often beyond their reach.\n</br>\n</br>\nIt is also noteworthy that ordinary citizens, despite being ill-equipped and untrained, have played crucial roles in rescue and relief efforts during disasters. Their courageous efforts are commendable, but they cannot substitute the need for a dedicated and well-equipped national-level disaster management system.\n</br>\n</br>\nGiven the increasing frequency and severity of natural and man-made disasters, it is imperative that disaster management is treated with the same level of priority as national security, including defense and counter-terrorism. The responsibility for ensuring national preparedness to face disaster situations must lie with the Central Government, which has the requisite expertise, infrastructure, and financial resources to manage such crises effectively.\n</br>\n</br>\nWe therefore urge the Union Government to consider bringing disaster management fully under its jurisdiction. This system should include the deployment of highly trained personnel, with experts drawn from the armed forces and other relevant agencies. Moreover, the responsibility for ensuring the welfare and compensation of those affected by disasters should also rest with the Central Government to ensure timely and effective support.\n</br>\n</br>\nConsidering the gravity of this issue and the potential impact on public safety, we request your esteemed office to take immediate steps to amend the Constitution to include disaster management in the Union List. Such a measure would greatly enhance India's ability to manage future disasters efficiently and effectively.\n</br>\n</br>\nThank you for your attention to this important matter. I trust that the Union Government will give this suggestion the serious consideration it deserves.\n</br>\n</br>\nYours faithfully,\n</br>\n</br>\nV.R. Ajith Kumar\nPresident, PEBS\n",
